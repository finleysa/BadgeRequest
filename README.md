# Riti

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

This was a template for a customer that acted as a pretty simple CRUD applicattion hosted on an internal server.

The idea is to save time on having to email visitors to the facility and just have the information stored in a local database on hand.
